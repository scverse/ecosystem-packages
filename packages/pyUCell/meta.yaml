description: |
  pyUCell is a package for evaluating gene signatures in single-cell datasets.
  pyUCell signature scores, based on the Mann-Whitney U statistic, are robust
  to dataset size and heterogeneity, and their calculation demands less
  computing time and memory than other available methods, enabling the
  processing of large datasets in a few minutes even on machines with limited
  computing power.
