description: |
  Statistical framework for holistic comparison of multi-condition single-cell datasets over continuous phenotypic manifolds.
  Kompot performs differential abundance and expression analysis agnostically to cell-type annotation or clustering,
  detecting differences that span the continuous manifold even when effects go in opposite directions across cell states.
  It models cell distributions and gene expression as continuous functions over cell state representations of arbitrary
  dimension (typically ~50 dimensions), enabling single-cell resolution
  inference with calibrated uncertainty estimates and capturing both global and cell-state-specific effects of perturbation.
