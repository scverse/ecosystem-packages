description: |
    Cell2location is a Bayesian model that can resolve fine-grained cell types in spatial transcriptomic data 
    and create comprehensive cellular maps of diverse tissues. Cell2location accounts for technical sources 
    of variation and borrows statistical strength across locations, thereby enabling the integration of single-cell 
    and spatial transcriptomics with higher sensitivity and resolution than existing tools.
