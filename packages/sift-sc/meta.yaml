description: |
  SiFT is a computational framework which aims to uncover the underlying structure by filtering out previously exposed biological signals.
  SiFT can be applied to a wide range of tasks, from (i) the removal of unwanted variation as a pre-processing step, through (ii) revealing hidden biological structure by utilizing prior knowledge with respect to existing signal, to (iii) uncovering trajectories of interest using reference data to remove unwanted variation.
