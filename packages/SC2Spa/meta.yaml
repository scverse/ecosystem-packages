name: SC2Spa
description: |
  SC2Spa is a deep learning-based tool for predicting the spatial coordinates of single cells based on transcriptome.
  Two paired single cell and spatial transcriptomic datasets are required to run SC2Spa. SC2Spa is trained on a ST reference
  dataset to learn the relationship of gene expression and spatial coordinates. The trained fully-connected neural network
  can be used to predict the locations of a single cell with only the transcriptomic profile as input. The predicted locations
  of single cells can be further used to study the communication of the single cells.
