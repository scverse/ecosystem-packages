description: |
  Scanpy is a scalable toolkit for analyzing single-cell gene expression data built jointly
  with anndata. It includes preprocessing, visualization, clustering, trajectory inference
  and differential expression testing. The Python-based implementation efficiently deals
  with datasets of more than one million cells.
