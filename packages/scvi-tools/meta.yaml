description: |
  scvi-tools is a library for developing and deploying machine learning models based on
  PyTorch and AnnData. With an emphasis on probabilistic models, scvi-tools streamlines
  the development process via training, data management, and user interface abstractions.
  scvi-tools also contains easy-to-use implementations of more than 14 state-of-the-art
  probabilistic models in the field.
